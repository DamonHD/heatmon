# Headless setup

If you want to access & configure the Raspberry Pi via SSH rather than connecting a monitor & keyboard, you can enable the SSH Server & copy in your WiFi SSID and password so it connects to your network automatically.

See https://github.com/tyrken/heatmon/wiki/Initial-Raspberry-Pi-Setup for docs.
